Using the "find" command locates two nvc++ versions on host (Intel Xeon).
One for x86_64 and the other for ARM64. Use x86_64 for Xeon and ARM64 for Grace Hopper.

/opt/nvidia/hpc_sdk/Linux_x86_64/24.7/compilers/bin/nvc++
/opt/nvidia/hpc_sdk/Linux_aarch64/24.7/compilers/bin/nvc++

Path is almost the same (but not quite) as existing path in makefile

MPI paths use:

/opt/intel/oneapi/mpi/latest/lib
/opt/intel/oneapi/mpi/latest/include

Path in build script same as azure
